# TinyML_project
This is TinyML_project for the "AI for embeded systems" subject - DANG Hoang San

This project consists of two sub-projects :

- The first sub-project (PARTIE_1_ClassificationVibrations) allows classification of different vibration modes measured by the gyroscope integrated on the Arduino card (Arduino Nano 33 BLE). The machine learning model used is a model trained through Jupyter notebook.

- The second sub-project (PARTIE_2_ClassificationComposants) allows classification of different electronic components via the OV767X camera using the model trained by Edge Impulse. From there, it will pass this data to Node-Red and count the number of detected objects. The machine learning model used is a model trained through Edge Impulse.
