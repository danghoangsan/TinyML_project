# TinyML_project
This is TinyML_project for the "AI for embeded systems" subject - DANG Hoang San
This project consists of two sub-projects.

The first sub-project allows classification of different vibration modes measured by the gyroscope integrated on the Arduino card.

The second sub-project allows classification of different electronic components via the OV767X camera using the model trained by Edge Impulse. From there, it will pass this data to Node-Red and count the number of detected objects.
